What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A new folder named ".git" is created in the current working directory.
	This stores all of the information needed to begin a repository and
	start making commits for whatever files I want.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area holds files that will be added to the repository,
	but have not yet been added.  It also helps distinguish those files 
	from other files in the working directory that are not going to be 
	committed at this time.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Use git diff --staged to compare what's in the staging area with the most
	recent commit to make sure the only changes present are the ones intended.
